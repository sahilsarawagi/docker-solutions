# DevOps with Docker Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the assignments and exercises from the [DevOps with Docker](https://devopswithdocker.com/) course.

Each folder corresponds to a different section of the course, containing the Dockerfiles, scripts, and other necessary files for completing the tasks.

Feel free to explore the solutions and use them as a reference for your own projects or to enhance your understanding of Docker and DevOps concepts.

Happy coding!
